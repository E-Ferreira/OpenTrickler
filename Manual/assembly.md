## Assemble Open Trickler Rear Body

### Overview

![open_trickler_rear_body_overview.png](Resources/open_trickler_rear_body_overview.png)

### Component Prep

This design relies heavily on heatset inserts. Make sure you have the proper inserts (check the hardware
reference for a close up picture and the BOM for dimensions).

Melt 4x heatset inserts to the bottom part of the rear body with your soldering iron. Make sure 
heatset inserts are flush with the bottom surface. 

![open_trickler_rear_body_install_heatset_inserts.png](Resources/open_trickler_rear_body_install_heatset_inserts.png)

### Assembly

Press 6804-2RS bearing to the top cut out and 608-2RS to the bottom cut out. [Printable bearing insert helpers](../STL/OpenTrickler/Tools) are supplied if you want to use bench top vise in this application. 

![open_trickler_rear_body_install_bearings.png](Resources/open_trickler_rear_body_install_bearings.png)

Slide the bearing cover to the rear cut out. The cover should sit flush with the top of the rear body, while two bearings are still free to rotate without resistance.

If you can feel the abnormal resistance after installing the bearing cover, press the bearings inwards for additional 0.1mm to clear the interference. 

![open_trickler_rear_body_install_bearing_cover](Resources/open_trickler_rear_body_install_bearing_cover.png)

Use 8x M3x8 BHCS screws with the optional equal number of M3 shim washers to fix two stepper motors onto the rear body, but don't tighten them yet. Make sure the motor can slide left to right. 

![open_trickler_rear_body_install_motors.png](Resources/open_trickler_rear_body_install_motors.png)

Slide 2x 40T pulley to the motor shaft but don't tighten the set screws yet. The pulley height will be adjusted in the later step.

![open_trickler_rear_body_install_pulley.png](Resources/open_trickler_rear_body_install_pulley.png)

Slide the rear door to the cut out and the rear body assembly is complete.
